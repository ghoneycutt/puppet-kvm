This module was tested on CentOS 6. Might work in Fedora if the package names are the same. 

Comments/Suggestions/Patches are welcome. Take a look at the project on GitHub.

WARNING : This module looks far from "pretty", it will probably have flaws in anything that is not CentOS6.

It worked for me after I modified few things from ghoneycutt, so I uploaded the "works OOTB on CentOS 6" version.

It probably doesn't comply with lints, best practices and all other fancy things. I won't have time to make it better either. Feel free to submit patches.

This is a quick-and-dirty solution that does the job for what it says here. On Vanilla CentOS 6, I ran this and start libvirtd successfully. Enjoy!
